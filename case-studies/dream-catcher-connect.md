## ðŸš§ Background

Dream Catcher Connect's client was operating a legacy Drupal website tailored to their specific organizatioal workflows. Over time, the platform becaome increasingly difficult to maintain, add new features to, and less aligned with the evolving needs of the business.

Rather than upgrade the Drupal system from version 7 to version 11, the team opted to migrate to WordPress to take advantage of its broader ecosystem and ease of maintenance.

I was brought on as a WordPress development expert to assist with re-architecting key features and ensuring a smooth transition. Partway through the project, I assumed full ownership of the migration when the previous developer moved on from the industry.

## ðŸ”¨ My Contribution

- ** Plugin Development:** Created custom WordPress plugins to mirror business logic previously embedded in Drupal, ensuring parity of functionality across key systems.
- **Rescue & Debug:** Completed, stabilized, and test existing migration tools that had been left unfinished. This included deep dive triage to get critical reporting and system functions back online.
- **Stakeholder Management:** Serverd as a communicationbridge between stakeholders and tech stack-calming tensions, clarifying technical blockers, and delivery regular updates with transparency.

## ðŸ’­ Takeaway

This project sharpened my ability to take ownership midstream, decipher legacy systems, and re-architect solutions with both technical soundness and business empathy. It was also a great reminder that **transitions aren't just technicalâ€”they're human**.
