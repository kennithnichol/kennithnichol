## 🧩 Project Summary

Improve The News required internal tools to streamline the curation and management of vast datasets related to articles and public figures. The existing systems were prototypes and slowing down their team of curators. I joined a globally distributed development team tasked with modernizing these internal tools.

## 🔨 My Contribution

- **Collaborative Full-Stack Development:** Worked with a small remote team to build a React + Next.js interface and enhance the PHP + MySQL backend to support more efficient data workflows.
- **UI for Analysts:** Co-developed an intuitive GUI to help curators and analysts review and organize article clusters, improving speed and clarity in data review processes.
- **Feature Ownership:** Led development of a public-figure metadata management tool—allowing users to tag, update, and organize complex entity data.
- **Cross-Time-Zone Coordination:** Operated autonomously in a fully asynchronous team using Jira for task management and GitHub for code reviews—ensuring progress, even across time zones.
